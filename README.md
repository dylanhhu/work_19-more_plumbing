Dylan Hu - Work 19: More Plumbing

## Description
This project uses two executables to create and use named pipes in order to send data between two running programs. This project compiles two executables. The first creates the pipes, prompts the user for input, and relays to and from the other worker program. The other recieves the data passed through, and reverses the data.

## Compilation and Execution
Use `make` to compile all needed executables. Run `./ui` first, then either run `./worker` in another terminal or do a switch-a-roo with both.

Exit using ctrl+c for both programs.
